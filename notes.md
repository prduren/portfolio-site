# Styling Notes

## OFFSET YOUR SHADOWS

`box-shadow: 0 4px 6px 0 hsla(0, 0%, 0%, 0.2)`

is, for example, much more natural to the human eye.

This applies to inset shadows such as wells for input forms as well.

## USE FEWER BORDERS

Instead, use:

// a box shadow

// two different background colors

// extra spacing

## USE ACCENT COLORS TO ADD TO BLAND DESIGN

Such as a border-top, border-bottom, or underline
